## Unprioritized
- Lint shell scripts with shellcheck
- Add script to automate dotfile updating, syncing
- Finish post init scripts
- Write a script that prints various detected values from shell scripts to debug if they are working
- Write CI check to make sure checked in version still works on major distros?
