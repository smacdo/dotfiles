## About
This is a collection of assorted shell scripts, shell configuration files and
common application plugins that are replicated across my various linux machines.
The only notable feature of my dotfile repository is that I strive to add
comments where appropriate to explain what each configuration setting does, and
to try to keep this cross platform between OS X, Linux and (where appropriate)
Windows.

Please take anything of value from this repository for use in your own dotfiles.
Attribution is appreciated but not required. Do not directly copy these dotfiles
without examining them first!
